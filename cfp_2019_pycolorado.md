# Collaborative Data Science with Docker Compose

## Submitted by

Scott Stoltzman

## Description

Data scientists and analysts need a common set of tools and data in order to be successful. 

In this tutorial, you will learn how to create and deploy a full-stack application with Docker Compose in order to bring together four great tools: Flask, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and JupyterLab.    

## Audience

This is an intermediate-level tutorial for people who work in data science and are looking to utilize collaborative environments. This tutorial assumes people have a basic understanding of Git, Docker, Jupyter Notebooks and web APIs.  

## Objectives

By the end of this tutorial, you will be able to...

1. Share a common set of tools and libraries amongst a group of users
2. Configure and run services locally with Docker and Docker Compose
3. Install Flask, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, and JupyterLab on a Digital Ocean Droplet
4. Create scalable and collaborative analysis platform that runs in a web browser
